          echo "BEFORE our steps:"
          echo "  ✓ Set up job - Prepares the runner"
          echo ""
          echo "AFTER our steps:"
          echo "  ✓ Complete job - Cleans up the runner"
          echo ""
          echo "These steps are AUTOMATIC and NOT in our YAML!"

# 📌 OBSERVE: Expand the job in GitHub Actions UI
# 📌 OBSERVE: "Set up job" step at the TOP (shows runner info)
# 📌 OBSERVE: "Complete job" step at the BOTTOM
# 📌 OBSERVE: These steps exist even if your YAML has no steps
# 📌 MCQ TIP: Total steps = Your steps + GitHub's auto steps
