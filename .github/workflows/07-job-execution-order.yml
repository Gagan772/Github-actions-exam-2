# WHY: By default, jobs run in PARALLEL. Understanding this is crucial
#      for knowing when to add dependencies between jobs.

# 📌 OBSERVE in GitHub UI:
# - All 3 jobs START at approximately the SAME TIME
# - They run in PARALLEL, not sequential
# - Total workflow time ≈ 3 seconds (not 9 seconds)
