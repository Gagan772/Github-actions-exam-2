# CONCEPT 16: env at Workflow Level
# WHY: Define environment variables once, use in ALL jobs and steps.
#      Most broad scope for env vars.

name: 16 - Workflow Level env Demo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  # These are available to ALL jobs and ALL steps
  APP_NAME: "MyAwesomeApp"
  VERSION: "1.0.0"
  ENVIRONMENT: "production"

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Access workflow env in Job 1
        run: |
          echo "🌐 WORKFLOW-LEVEL Environment Variables"
          echo "App Name: $APP_NAME"
          echo "Version: $VERSION"
          echo "Environment: $ENVIRONMENT"

  job-two:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Access same env in Job 2
        run: |
          echo "🌐 Same variables available in Job 2!"
          echo "App Name: $APP_NAME"
          echo "Version: $VERSION"
          echo "Environment: $ENVIRONMENT"
          echo ""
          echo "✅ Workflow-level env is shared across ALL jobs"

# 📌 OBSERVE: Both jobs can access the same env variables
# 📌 OBSERVE: env block is at the TOP level (same indent as 'on:' and 'jobs:')
