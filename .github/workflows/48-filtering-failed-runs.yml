# CONCEPT 48: Filtering Failed Workflow Runs
# WHY: Quickly find failed runs to debug issues.
#      Filter by status in Actions tab.

name: 48 - Filtering Failed Runs Demo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      should_fail:
        description: 'Make this run fail?'
        required: true
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  conditional-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Conditional pass/fail
        run: |
          if [ "${{ inputs.should_fail }}" == "true" ]; then
            echo "❌ Intentionally failing..."
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ Passing successfully!"
          fi

# 📌 HOW TO CREATE TEST DATA:
# 1. Run workflow with should_fail=false (creates success)
# 2. Run workflow with should_fail=true (creates failure)
# 3. Repeat a few times to create multiple runs
#
# 📌 HOW TO FILTER FAILED RUNS:
#
# Method 1: Status Dropdown
# 1. Go to Actions tab
# 2. Click "Status" dropdown (or filter icon)
# 3. Select "Failure"
# 4. Only failed runs are shown!
#
# Method 2: URL Parameter
# Add to URL: ?query=is%3Afailure
# Example: /actions?query=is%3Afailure
#
# Method 3: Search Query
# 1. Click in filter/search box
# 2. Type: is:failure
# 3. Press Enter
#
# 📌 OTHER USEFUL FILTERS:
# - is:success (only successful runs)
# - is:cancelled (only cancelled runs)
# - is:in_progress (only running)
# - is:waiting (waiting for approval)
# - actor:username (runs by specific user)
# - branch:main (runs on main branch)
#
# 📌 COMBINING FILTERS:
# is:failure branch:main actor:octocat
#
# 📌 MCQ TIP: Use "is:failure" filter to find failed workflows
