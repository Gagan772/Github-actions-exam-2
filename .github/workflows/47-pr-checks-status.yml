#
# 1. CHECKS TAB in PR:
#    - Shows all workflow jobs that ran
#    - Each check has status indicator
#    - Click "Details" to see full logs
#
# 2. MERGE BOX area:
#    - "All checks have passed" (green)
#    - "Some checks have failed" (red)
#    - "Checks are pending" (yellow)
#
# 3. STATUS ICONS next to commits:
#    - Green ✓ = All checks passed
#    - Red ✗ = Some checks failed
#    - Yellow ● = Checks in progress
#
# 📌 MCQ TIP: PR Checks = convenient view of workflow status for PRs
