# CONCEPT 23: Why Variables Are Preferred Over Hardcoded Paths
# WHY: Hardcoded paths break across different runners/OS.
#      Variables ensure portability and maintainability.

# 📌 OBSERVE: Same variable names work on all 3 operating systems
# 📌 MCQ TIP: Always use GITHUB_WORKSPACE instead of hardcoded paths
