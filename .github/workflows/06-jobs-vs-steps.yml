# CONCEPT 6: Jobs vs Steps
# WHY: Jobs run in PARALLEL by default on SEPARATE runners.
#      Steps run SEQUENTIALLY within a SINGLE job on SAME runner.

  # JOB 1 - Has multiple steps
  job-alpha:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 1 in Job Alpha

          echo "⏰ Time: $(date +%H:%M:%S)"
          echo "✅ Steps run SEQUENTIALLY (one after another)"

  # JOB 2 - Runs in PARALLEL with Job Alpha
  job-beta:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 1 in Job Beta
        run: |
          echo "🅱️ JOB BETA - Step 1"
          echo "⏰ Time: $(date +%H:%M:%S)"
          echo "✅ Jobs run in PARALLEL (same time as Job Alpha)"
      
      - name: Step 2 in Job Beta
        run: |
          echo "🅱️ JOB BETA - Step 2"
          echo "⏰ Time: $(date +%H:%M:%S)"

# 📌 OBSERVE: Both jobs start at nearly the same time (parallel)
# 📌 OBSERVE: Steps within each job run one after another (sequential)
