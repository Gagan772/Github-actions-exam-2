# CONCEPT 14: Error Annotations (::error::)
# WHY: Creates a visible ERROR annotation in GitHub UI.
#      NOTE: ::error:: does NOT fail the step - use 'exit 1' to fail!

          echo "  OR"
          echo "  a command that returns non-zero exit code"

# 📌 OBSERVE: Red error icons appear in Annotations section
# 📌 OBSERVE: But the workflow SUCCEEDS (green checkmark)!
# 📌 MCQ TIP: ::error:: creates annotation, doesn't fail the job
