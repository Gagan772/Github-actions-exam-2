# CONCEPT 29: Docker Container Action
# WHY: Run action in an isolated Docker container.
#      Useful for consistent environment or specific OS tools.

          echo "- Isolated from runner environment"
          echo "- ⚠️ ONLY works on Linux runners!"

# 📌 OBSERVE: Docker image is built before action runs
# 📌 OBSERVE: Action executes inside container
# 📌 MCQ TIP: Docker actions ONLY run on Linux, not Windows/macOS
